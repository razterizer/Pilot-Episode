# Pilot Episode
A cross-platform (Lin/Mac/Win) terminal-based shooter game.

## Build & Run Instructions (Windows)

You need the following header-only libraries that I've made:
* https://github.com/razterizer/Core-Lib
* https://github.com/razterizer/Consolation
* https://github.com/razterizer/8Beat

Make sure the folder structure looks like this:
```
<my_source_code_dir>/lib/Core Lib                 ; Core-Lib repo workspace/checkout goes here.
<my_source_code_dir>/lib/Terminal Text Lib        ; Consolation repo workspace/checkout goes here.
<my_source_code_dir>/lib/8-Bit Audio Emulator Lib ; 8Beat repo workspace/checkout goes here.
<my_source_code_dir>Pilot Episode                 ; Pilot-Episode repo workspace/checkout goes here.
```

Then just open `<my_source_code_dir>/Pilot Episode/Pilot Episode/Pilot Episode.sln` and build and run. That's it!
